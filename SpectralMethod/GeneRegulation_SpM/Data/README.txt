in folder 'initial_hill1' there is data from rates g(n)=q(n)=(qminus*n0**nu + qplus*n**nu)/(n**nu + n0**nu)
with constants:
rho = 1.0
qplus = 13.
qminus = 1.
n0 = 8.
nu = 4.
shifts g and q are parameters


in 'initial_hill2' there is data from rates g(n)=q(n)=(qminus*n0**nu + qplus*n**nu)/(n**nu + n0**nu)
with constants:
rho = 1.0
qplus = 12.0
qminus = 1.0
n0 = 4.0
nu = 4.0
shifts g and q are parameters


in folder 'initial_hill3' there is again data from rates g(n)=q(n)=(qminus*n0**nu + qplus*n**nu)/(n**nu + n0**nu)
with constants:
rho = 1.0
qplus = 12.0
qminus = 1.0
n0 = 4.0
nu = 4.0
but here the shifts g and q are found by calculating <g(n)> = sum(p(n)*g(n)) with p(n) the analytically found input distribution.


in folder 'initial_poisson_g7' there is data from rates g(n)=const=7. and q(n)=(qminus*n0**nu + qplus*n**nu)/(n**nu + n0**nu)
with constants:
rho = 1.0
qplus = 12.0
qminus = 1.0
n0 = 4.0
nu = 4.0
the shifts g and q are found by calculating <q(n)> = sum(p(n)*g(n)) with p(n) the analytically found poissonian input distribution.
